This project aims to build a tool to work with sounds/audio files i.e. to extend the functionalities of Amppper. I wish to build sort of a music editing tool for personal use. I am not sure if it will end that way but I hope it sure will be something worth and not just another useless project (though usability is limited to my personal use cases).
